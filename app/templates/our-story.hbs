          <p>
            The Apothecary Shoppe in Las Vegas is more than a cannabis
            dispensary. We believe in a higher purpose, one devoted to the
            well-being of our community and to the creation of a positive
            cannabis culture in Nevada. That purpose includes being on the
            vanguard of research â€“ giving our doctors, concierges and you the
            greatest insight into the incredible benefits of medicinal cannabis.
            That insight will guide the way to making this natural medicine a
            proven, safe and legal alternative treatment for patients
            everywhere. All this, together with our state-of-the-art grow house,
            unique products and homemade gourmet edibles raises the standard by
            which every other cannabis dispensary will be measured.
