            Cannabis clinical trials lie at the heart of our mission, and The
            Apothecary Shoppe is the only dispensary in Las Vegas overseeing a
            range of unprecedented clinical trials in cannabis-based therapies.
            Our team of physicians, led by Dr. Nick Spirtos, specialize in a
            spectrum of medical conditions ranging from cancer to pain and
            seizures. Our goal is to reduce opiate addiction and the side effects
            of current medication used to treat these conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trials will record results from patients dealing with chronic pain
            and cancer. Dr. Spirtos is particularly interested in those going
            through chemotherapy. Many patients do not finish their recommended
            chemotherapy regimen due to the side effects, mainly nausea and
            vomiting. By reducing these side effects with medicinal cannabis, more
            might be willing to finish their chemotherapy. You can follow our
            doctorsâ€™ progress, as well as learn more about cannabis clinical
            research around the globe, in our social media community on Facebook,
            Twitter and Instagram.
