            As curators in the science of horticulture and craft cannabis, our
            growers work tirelessly to provide our patients with pure, safe and
            healthy cannabis flower. Our facility uses no pesticides and fully
            protects the plants from the harsh desert climate. This carefully
            monitored environment means bigger, denser buds, increased potency and
            higher resin yields.
